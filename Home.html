        <h2>Welcome to Sh. L.N. Hindu College</h2>
        <p>
          Sh. L.N. Hindu College previously known as Hindu College was founded
          in 1971 by the Hindu Education Society, Rohtak, for providing
          value-based education to the growing number of students. To
          accommodate more and more Students, the College Management purchased
          13 acres of land on Bhiwani Road, Rohtak, on which the foundation
          stone of the new building was laid by 1008 Swami Gurucharan Dass Ji
          Maharaj in 1974. Subsequently, the heirs of Shri Lal Nath donated 250
          Acres of agricultural land to the society. Hence, the college was
          renamed as Sh. L. N. Hindu College. The college has now carved out its
          special place on the educational Map of Haryana. It enjoys the
          reputation of being the premier Institution imparting the quality
          education in Arts, Commerce, Science, Management, and Information
          Technology. Our college is committed to the noble task of developing
          an all-round personality of the students. We have an experienced and
          well-qualified team of dedicated members of the staff. We are proud of
          the fact that many of our lecturers and students have been selected in
          IAS, HCS, and in reputed companies of India and abroad. No doubt, our
          college has always enjoyed the reputation of having created
          academically meritorious students. It has been our constant endeavor
          to groom the personality of the students by giving them exposure in
          the fields of culture, sports, and other extracurricular activities.
          Our students always bring laurels to the institution by grabbing the
          highest academic positions at the university level. Every year, more
          than 100 students from each stream secure top positions in university
          examinations. As a token of recognition of the high-quality
          performance in all fields of education, our college was accredited
          with B (CGPA 2.74) grade by NAAC in the year 2016. Fortunately, the
          College Management is always more than ready to provide the funds and
          other necessary support for the fulfillment of the institutionâ€™s
          mission. Several quality enhancement activities like Extension
          lecture, Seminar, Workshops, and Quiz, etc are organized by
          institutions regularly. Recently our YRC unit was felicitated with the
          award of excellence for organizing Youth Red Cross activities by the
          University. Moreover, our students participate regularly in State and
          National level competitions and make the college proud.
